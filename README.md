# Generating Nodes in a Social Network using GANs

![Node Example](node1.jpg)

This repository contains code for generating node representations in a social network using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are utilized to learn the underlying distribution of nodes in a graph, allowing for the generation of new, realistic node representations that can be used for various downstream tasks in social network analysis.

## Overview

In social network analysis, understanding the structure and characteristics of nodes (individual entities) is crucial for tasks such as recommendation systems, community detection, and link prediction. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features or embeddings generated from simple algorithms like node2vec or DeepWalk. This project explores the use of GANs to generate node representations that capture complex dependencies and structures present in social networks.
